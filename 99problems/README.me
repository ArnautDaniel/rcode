I thought these exercises looked pretty good for getting a somewhat steady grasp on the language.  Since I'm trying to do 5 languages simulateously for some inane reason, I thought this would be a good starting place.  I'll obviously be beginning with Lisp although I've already done some of these in Haskell.
