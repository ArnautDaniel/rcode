This folder contains an attempt to work through the "Introduction to Algorithms" book. Which is one hell of an abuse of the
word introduction for a tome this big.

Since I'm verifiably crazy after running around through different programming languages like a maniac, only to discover there are other "maniacs" called programming language theory nerds (ha, nerds) who essentially do the same thing but call it science rather than madness;  I would like to attempt to implement all the algorithms I can in C, Scheme, and Forth all while dreaming of learning enough to write some sick compilers and generally motioning closer to total world dominance (or at a small cubical where I can write greek emo poetry about the spiritual struggle of being forced to learn Java)

It should be fun.
