/* It feels pretty gross having to deal with side effects like this.
   Just calling insertion_sort on an array and suddenly it's changed?
   I'm sure the speed is much greater than my destructive sort in Scheme
   though.

   It's almost like every language is just a long list of design choices
   between being explict or implicit, and I can't get over the fact that
   C is so damn implicit when it comes to side-effects.  Scheme's method of
   appending a "!" to destructive functions is a much safer feeling.

   Now that I've finished the sort in both Scheme and C we turn to the
   horror of thinking about how to do this in Forth.

   I'm fair sure it's masochistic to use 3 languages in different *-fix's.
   Post-fix, pre-fix and in-fix.  I'm an addict for crazy mind-bending and
   this is the only way I get my fix.
