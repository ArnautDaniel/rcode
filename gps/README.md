I wanted to try taking some lisp code and translating it into factor.  So far I haven't spent too much time on it,  but it is rather interesting.  Factor demands much heavier factoring (heh), and also has a strict chronological rule (definitions have to appear in order unless you DEFER: them).

Stack juggling is clearly nonsense but luckily it seems the combinator library has most of the things I was trying to implement.
